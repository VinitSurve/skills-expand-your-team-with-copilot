## Template Design

Each template is designed to provide:

- **Clear problem description** - What needs to be done
- **Clear acceptance criteria** - How to know when it's complete
- **Implementation hints** - Technical guidance for developers
- **Context and limitations** - Important constraints and background

This ensures that Copilot coding agents or developers can be assigned these tasks without needing additional clarification.

## For Developers

These templates include detailed acceptance criteria and implementation hints specifically designed for AI coding assistants and developers. Each template provides:

- Specific files that may need modification
- Implementation guidelines and best practices
- Testing requirements
- Common pitfalls to avoid

## Configuration

The `config.yml` file controls the issue template behavior and includes links to additional resources like documentation and discussion forums.
