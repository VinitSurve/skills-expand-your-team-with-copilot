# Issue Templates Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

**Original Issue**: Teachers are not comfortable modifying program directly and are unsure what to put in issues to explain what they need.

**Solution**: Created 7 comprehensive GitHub issue templates that provide structured forms for common teacher requests, ensuring enough detail for Copilot coding agents to implement changes without further explanation.

## Templates Created

### 1. **Add New Activity** (`add-new-activity.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Request new extracurricular activities
- **Key Fields**: Activity name, description, category, schedule, capacity, teacher sponsor
- **Special Features**: Dropdown for activity types, checkbox for meeting days, time validation
- **Copilot Guidance**: Database structure, time format conversion, validation requirements

### 2. **Modify Existing Activity** (`modify-activity.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Update existing activity details
- **Key Fields**: Activity selection, change types, new values, reason for changes
- **Special Features**: Selective modification, data preservation options
- **Copilot Guidance**: Participant data migration, validation constraints

### 3. **Student Registration Issue** (`student-registration-issue.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Report enrollment problems
- **Key Fields**: Issue type, student email, activity, error details, reproduction steps
- **Special Features**: Comprehensive troubleshooting checklist, urgency levels
- **Copilot Guidance**: API debugging, authentication checks, data integrity

### 4. **Bug Report** (`bug-report.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Report technical issues
- **Key Fields**: Bug category, reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior
- **Special Features**: Browser/device info, frequency tracking, impact assessment
- **Copilot Guidance**: Debugging process, testing requirements, common bug locations

### 5. **Feature Request** (`feature-request.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Request new functionality
- **Key Fields**: Feature category, problem statement, use case, priority
- **Special Features**: Complexity acknowledgment, alternative solutions
- **Copilot Guidance**: Requirements analysis, implementation strategy, testing needs

### 6. **UI/UX Improvement** (`ui-ux-improvement.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Improve user interface and experience
- **Key Fields**: Improvement type, affected area, current problems, proposed solutions
- **Special Features**: Device priorities, accessibility considerations, design elements
- **Copilot Guidance**: Design principles, implementation files, testing requirements

### 7. **General Request** (`general-request.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Catch-all for other needs
- **Key Fields**: Request type, description, current situation, desired outcome
- **Special Features**: Flexible categorization, scope assessment
- **Copilot Guidance**: Analysis process, alternative approaches

## Key Features

### For Teachers:
- **Easy to Use**: Dropdown menus, checkboxes, and guided forms
- **No Technical Knowledge Required**: Plain language prompts and examples
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Templates for all common scenarios
- **Clear Guidance**: Each template explains what information is needed

### For Copilot Agents:
- **Detailed Acceptance Criteria**: Clear success conditions for each request
- **Implementation Hints**: Technical guidance and best practices
- **File Locations**: Specific files and areas to modify
- **Testing Requirements**: Validation steps and quality checks
- **Context and Limitations**: Important constraints and considerations

### System Benefits:
- **Structured Requests**: Consistent format across all issue types
- **Sufficient Detail**: Required fields ensure completeness
- **Reduced Back-and-Forth**: Templates minimize need for clarification
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation and testing guidance

## Technical Implementation

### Template Structure:
```yaml
name: Template Name
description: Brief description
title: "[LABEL] Title prefix"
labels: ["category", "type", "teacher-request"]
body:
  - type: input/textarea/dropdown/checkboxes
    validations:
      required: true/false
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        ## Acceptance Criteria
        **For Copilot Agent**: Implementation guidance
```

### Configuration:
- **Blank Issues Disabled**: Forces use of templates
- **Contact Links**: Documentation and discussion alternatives
- **Organized Categories**: Clear distinction between issue types

## Validation Results

✅ **All 7 templates pass validation**
- Proper YAML syntax and structure
- Required fields for completeness
- Acceptance criteria for Copilot agents
- Clear implementation guidance
- Comprehensive field coverage

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Reduced Teacher Friction**: Easy-to-use forms eliminate technical barriers
2. **Improved Issue Quality**: Structured templates ensure sufficient detail
3. **Faster Implementation**: Clear guidance enables autonomous Copilot work
4. **Better Communication**: Consistent format improves understanding
5. **Reduced Maintenance**: Self-documenting issues reduce support overhead

## How to Use

1. Navigate to repository Issues → New Issue
2. Select appropriate template from the list
3. Fill out the structured form
4. Submit issue for Copilot agent assignment

The templates transform the issue creation process from a technical writing task into a simple form-filling exercise, while ensuring that all necessary information is captured for successful implementation.
